# Learning-Python
Simple programs to learn Python

Each file is divided in 3 parts:
1. The instructions for the program to write (surrounded by """)
2. The code
3. Examples to test the code

While the following files were designed by Matt to help me get started, the rest are problems from Leetcode:
- signs.py
- absolute_value.py
- length_list.py
- factorial.py
- sum_numbers_list.py
- list_product.py
- boolean_1.py
- boolean_2.py
- my_list_item.py
- Fibonacci.py

Thank you Matt for creating those instructions!
